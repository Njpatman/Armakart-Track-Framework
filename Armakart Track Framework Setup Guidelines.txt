Armakart Track Framework Setup Instructions/Guidelines

 - General Track Setup

  -- Just generalized information of any and functions in the track.

    * It is heavily recommended that you simply create a mission folder right now, simply save a map in Eden and overwrite all files in the save folder with the files in the "Armakart_Track_Framework.VR" folder. (including mission.sqm)

    * There's no real limit to how many racers you can have, just simply place as many as needed based on your groups average player count.

    * The intro sequences orbital camera track can be modified in init.sqf.

    * in Armakart_Main\Params.hpp is where all the default values are (Laps_number, Customization_Phase_Time, Voting_Phase_Enabled, Voting_Phase_Time) change all to what you want.

    * Players and finish line should not really need to be touched, but feel free to mess with different starting configurations with the players, you may make your own custom finish line to accommodate larger players sizes and track width, but you need a object with the variable name "FINISH_LINE" at the center of your custom finish line. 

    * To add custom music, simply replace "music.ogg" in Armakart_Main\Armakart_Sounds\Armakart_Sounds_Music with a different .ogg file with the same name (might have to reload arma to have it take affect in-game).

    * If you want to change the kart vehicle itself (not really recommended) you simply have to change the karts players spawn on in the editor and in the script Armakart_Main\Armakart_Scripts\Start_Race.sqf line 162 change "C_Quadbike_01_F" to whatever classname your new kart is.

      -NOTE: IF YOU CHANGE THE KART YOU WILL NEED TO CHECK EVERY POWERUP THAT SPAWNS AND ATTACHES OBJECTS TO PLAYERS KARTS TO MAKE SURE NOTHING IS FUCKED (ESPECIALLY THE BANANA POWERUP).

 (It is heavily recommended that you simply open the mission file in the Eden Editor to be able to physically see what I'm talking about)

 - Powerup Blocks 

   -- Powerup Blocks are how players get their powerups, 

    * Place Powerup Blocks 1.5m above track to keep consistency.

    * ORIENTATION MATTERS - make sure the powerup blocks are oriented in the general direction the players will be hitting them.

    * Be creative with Placement, I'm not your mother. (use "Armakart_Main\Armakart_Scripts\Armakart_Scripts_Powerups\Powerup_Template.sqf" to create your own powerups.)


 - Powerup Spawn Object

   -- A object that powerups can safely spawn around.

    * Simply keep the object above sea and ground level and out of sight of the track.


 - Camera Look Positions

   -- Where the intro sequences orbital cameras will focus on 
   
    * Recommend you place them around points of interests around your track.


 - Checkpoints

   -- Checkpoints are simple position/variable reset locations that should be littered throughout your track.


    * The orange VR selector in each checkpoints trigger is where players will teleport around, note that the orange VR selector doesn't need to be in the trigger

    * ORIENTATION MATTERS - The orange VR selector in each checkpoints trigger has to be rotated so it lines up with direction you want players to face after they reset.

    * You should never remove or move the orange VR selector in front of the finish line, but if you absolutely have to move it, make sure to extend or create a second finish lines trigger so it overlays the orange VR selector by 6.5m on all sides.


    * Make sure the variable number for each checkpoints teleport position object is correct, ie: 

       - Checkpoint 2s orange VR selector variable name is "CP_2".

       - Checkpoint 4s orange VR selector variable name is "CP_4".

       - etc.


    * There are two steps to adding or removing checkpoints.

      1. In init.sqf change the integer for the global variable "Checkpoints_number" (line 14) to how many checkpoints you physically have on the track (remember that the finish line checkpoint is still considered a checkpoint.)

      2a. [adding a checkpoint] In each checkpoints trigger in the eden editor change the activation conditions integer to the checkpoint number that was before the checkpoint your adding.

        In example:

        I want to add a 9th checkpoint, I'm first gonna copy checkpoint 8's orange VR arrow and trigger and paste them where I want the 9th checkpoint to be, I'm then going to open up its properties and go to "Conditions", and it should look like this:

         ______________________________________________________________________________
        |                                                                              |
        |   call { vehicle player in thisList && Current_Checkpoint isEqualTo 7 };     |
        |                                                                              |
        |______________________________________________________________________________|


        I'm simply gonna change the integer 7 in the condition to the number of the checkpoint that came before the 9th checkpoint, which in this case would be 8, so it should look like this:

         ______________________________________________________________________________
        |                                                                              |
        |   call { vehicle player in thisList && Current_Checkpoint isEqualTo 8 };     |
        |                                                                              |
        |______________________________________________________________________________|

        I'm then going to verify that the copied VR arrow says "CP_9".

      2b. [removing a checkpoint] simply delete the checkpoints trigger and Orange VR selector and make sure to update the trigger and variable names of any checkpoint after it.


 - Sub Checkpoints 

   -- Sub Checkpoints are how the in-race position system gets positional data from each player, so it is imperative that you follow these guidelines to the letter.

    * Sub Checkpoints can simply be copy and pasted from the first one to the last one, they must all be in order throughout the track for it to work properly.

    * There should be a Sub Checkpoint at each standard checkpoint, including the finish line one.

    * If you plan on having a wide track, make sure to change the triggers width to correlate with your track size (Armakart_Main\Armakart_Scripts\Armakart_Scripts_Server\Sub_Checkpoints.sqf line 16).

    * In init.sqf change the integer for the global variable "Sub_Checkpoints_Number" (line 16) to how many Sub Checkpoints you physically have on the track (make sure to include Sub_CP_0). 

    * Reference ArmaKart_Track_Dwg.png in the mission root folder:

     - As you can see the Sub Checkpoints are setup in a way to create a rough outline of the track, with the Sub Checkpoint number getting larger the further into the track you get.

     - The Sub Checkpoints are setup so they are in front of or on top of each Checkpoint Reset Beacon.

     - Sub Checkpoints are setup generally only on places where the track bends/changes direction.

     - This should basically be how your track looks like (except the Sub_CP if front of the finish line will be Sub_CP_0 NOT Sub_CP_1).
